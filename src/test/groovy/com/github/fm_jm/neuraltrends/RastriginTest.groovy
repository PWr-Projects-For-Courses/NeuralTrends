/**
 * genotype - we'll use the DoubleGenotype, it's basically List<Double>, perfect for us
 * creator - for heuristic learning from scratch randoming the weights will be fine, starting from pre-backpropagated
 *   weights will be more tricky because of the module-based architecture
 * phenotype - that could actually be a neural network with weights from the genotype
 * decoder - it will construct the network using given weights
 * evaluator - it will, guess what, evaluate the phenotype (network)
 * objective - I'm thinking single numerical objective, error or f-score or something like that
 *   minimized or maximized depending on what value we use
 *
 * PSO and EA are already implemented in opt4j, we can modify mutProb, crossProb etc, it seems good enough
 *
 * Our asses were smart enough not to write anything about custom genetic algorithm in the
 * topic declaration, so fuck that with a ten foot stick
 *
 *
 * Now, about this example script - I implemented the 2d rastrigin function optimization problem,
 * as described in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastrigin_function
 *
 * classes/modules should be self-explanatory with the above introduction
 *
 * near the bottom of the file we've got the meat - initializing problem, optimizer and running that shit
 *
 * I'll mark lines in which you can choose whether to use EA or PSO, just (un)comment the correct line
 * We've also got that awesome viewer, it will provide some tasty graphs for presentations and that god-forsaken paper
 *
 *
 * OK, a brand new idea for starting with some pre-learned weights - obviously we're not going to initialize each and
 * every specimen with the same genotype, that would make no sense. So we're gonna need some List<Double> of starting
 * weights in the Creator class, vary them up a little in the create() method and get a population of slightly
 * different 'networks'. The thing is we're not constructing the Creator object ourselves, so that list
 * would have to be in the class itself. Thankfully, we've got a meta-programming guy in our midst,
 * so it should be perfectly doable to create a class with given class-level list on demand and then
 * using it in the optimization process.
